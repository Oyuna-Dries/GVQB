# Project scope

One page website for Connor the barber.

Should get across the vintage vibe and be clear on the details.

Buttons at the top link to subsections down the page.

 - The barbershop - header, name and mission

 - Our services - The services and prices

 - Reach us - People will click here if they want an appointment so it could have contact details but also a clear message that you don't do appointments, and the address & hours

 - Gallery - since Connor has an awesome instagram to show off

 - Social media - IG and FB links

 Footer: contact details

 Contact form and a way for connor to edit the page himself are nice extras.
